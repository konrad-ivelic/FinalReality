Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of 
enemies controlled by the computer.

---

Assumptions:
-------
2 characters, enemies or weapons will be equal to each other if and only if they belong to the seme class and have the same name.

Some attributes of characters, enemies and weapons are static, meaning that can't be changed. This attributes do not have setters.
